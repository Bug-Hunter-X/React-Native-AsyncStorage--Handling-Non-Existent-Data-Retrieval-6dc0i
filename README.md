This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked bug in React Native's AsyncStorage: the unexpected error when retrieving data that does not exist. The `AsyncStorageBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, and the `AsyncStorageSolution.js` demonstrates the correct approach to handle this scenario.  The solution involves using `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle errors and prevent app crashes when AsyncStorage retrieval fails.  Always anticipate that a key might not be present and provide fallback mechanisms to maintain app stability.
